Statistical significance assessed using paired t-test. \textbf  {b}, Relationship between baseline model performance and absolute improvement ($\Delta F1$) achieved through customization. Each point represents one participant (P0-P7), with colors indicating improvement direction (green: positive, red: negative). Correlation coefficient quantifies the relationship between initial performance and improvement potential. \textbf  {c}, Per-participant comparison of base versus customized model F1 scores. Individual participant results demonstrate the consistency of improvement across the cohort, with paired bars showing before/after customization performance. \textbf  {d}, Training dynamics aligned by transition epoch, showing target validation loss relative to the onset of customization. Individual participant curves (gray) and population mean with confidence intervals (blue) demonstrate the learning trajectory during personalization. Vertical dashed line marks the transition from base training to customization phase. Curves terminate when fewer than three participants remain to ensure robust averaging.}}{2}{}\protected@file@percent }
